World Wide Music Festival

The point is this.  If the humanity does not seek to change, for the better, we will self-destruct.  This is the nature of things.  The fighting in Ukraine must stop before it is too late.  Before any further escalation occurs.  Here is the proposal:

Matsuri no Ato
A festival across the world is needed.  Planning and marketing of events in all major cities would start immediately.  Because this needs to happen now, the goal would be to start on the next full moon which is about 1 month from today.  We as people will need competition to occur and we should do so in a peaceful, non-lethal manner.  This is why the proposal includes wrestling.  It is the oldest sport in which humans chose to interact with one another, with a competitive spirit, but with respect for one another.

All activities besides competition would celebrate our creations. Our art, our technology, our structures, and our abstractions.  We will celebrate our existence.  

The goal is to cause a cease fire in the conflicts around the world for at least 7 days.  During this time, we can all reflect on our true nature and purpose for existence.  After the festival, we can resume, with a new perspective.
